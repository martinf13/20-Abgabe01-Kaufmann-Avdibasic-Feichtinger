## Project Description ##

The abstract class **"Drink"** represents the properties of a drink, including methods to get the Volume and the alcohol percentage.
A drink is a mix of liquids, which are represented in the class "Liquid".
The class **"Liquid"** represents properties of a liquid, could be alcoholic or non-alcoholic and different volumes.

## Project Task ##

We are creating **2 subclasses from "Drink"**, which are representing a special Drink, which contains various liquids and
consists an **instruction to mix/create the Drinks** correctly.
The instruction will be implemented with a HashMap (Key 1-; String text) to follow up the orders step by step.
